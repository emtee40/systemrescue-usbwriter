      Takes an .iso-image of SystemRescue and writes it to a USB memory stick. The USB memory stick is formatted as FAT32, so it is fully writeable. This is an advantage compared to copying the .iso-image with &quot;dd&quot; or similar methods that retain the ISO9660 filesystem which is read-only.

      SystemRescue (formerly known as SystemRescueCd) is a Linux system rescue toolkit available as a bootable medium for administrating or repairing your system and data after a crash. It aims to provide an easy way to carry out admin tasks on your computer, such as creating and editing the hard disk partitions.
